# Overview
The purpose of this vignette is to show how to use the *rSPAMM* package for assessment of various harp and hooded seal populations. It will guide you through the model fitting, obtaining estimated quantities, finding and exploring, various catch options, how to structure the data set, and how to visualize the modelled population dynamics. We also present the model used.


# Installation of the *rSPAMM* package and how to update it
The most recent version of *rSPAMM* is hosted on a git repository at [https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/rSPAMM.git](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/rSPAMM.git).

We recommend to use the RStudio software and the instructions assumes that the user makes use of this software. More advanced users not using RStudio will be able to follow the installation procedure described below and do it manually. In order to download the rSPAMM package you han download it from Git Hub by cloning the Git repository. In RStudio you do the following steps:

* Select: File -> New project
* Select: Version control
* Select: Git
* In the "Repository URL" box type: https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/rSPAMM.git
* Fill in the rest of the boxes depending on where you want the package stored on your computer
* In the console window type:
```{r eval = FALSE}
source("install_rSPAMM.R")
```

The *rSPAMM* package is now installed. To load the package type
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(rSPAMM)
library(TMB)
```

If you want to update the package to the most recent version you find the Git menu in the panel to the top right corner of RStudio. From there you click on the Pull button and then it will download the most recent version of *rSPAMM*. You have to install the package again by sourcing the installation script again.

# Data used by the population dynamics model and how to load them

The population dynamics model use historical catch records, fecundity rates, age specific proportions of mature females, and estimates of pup production to estimate the population size trajectory. Two types of reproductive data are used in the model: information on the proportion of females that are mature at a given age (i.e., maturity ogive) and the proportion of mature females that are pregnant at a given year (i.e. fecundity rate). In this section we will describe what type of data is used, which data files are needed, and the format the various data are stored.

# Data files
All data that is described below will be loaded and used by the model to fit the population dynamics. All data sets are found in the *Data/* folder separated into folders for each population.

## Catch data
Catch data are found in the file *catch_data.dat* and the content of the file looks like this:
```{r echo = FALSE}
catch_data <- read.table(paste("Data/harpeast/catch_data.dat",sep = ""),header = FALSE)
head(catch_data)
```
The first column contains the year, the seccond column contains the catch of pups, and the third column contains the catch of the 1+ population.

## Pup production estimates
Estimated pup production is found in the file *pup_production.dat*. The content of the file looks like this: 
```{r echo = FALSE}
pup_production <- read.table(paste("Data/harpeast/pup_production.dat",sep = ""),header = FALSE)
pup_production
```
In the first column you see the survey year, in the seccond column you see the estimated pup production, and in the third the estimated CV of that survey is given.

## Fecundity data
Fecundity data is found in the *fecundity.dat* file. The content of the file looks like this:
```{r echo = FALSE}
fecundity <- read.table(paste("Data/harpeast/fecundity.dat",sep = ""),header = FALSE)
fecundity
```
In the first column you have the year for when the fecundity is estimated, in the seccond column you have the estimated fecundity, and in the thirst column you have the estimated standard error of the fecundity estimate.

## Birth ogive
In the files *wgharp.ogi* and *wgharp.ogp* you find the birth ogive data, and the from which time periods the birth ogive curves applies for. The content of the *wgharp.ogi* looks like

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Birth ogives for different periods
Pdat <- read.table(paste("Data/harpeast/wgharp.ogi",sep = ""),sep = "",header = TRUE)
# Which periods the various birth ogives applies to
Pper <- read.table(paste("Data/harpeast/wgharp.ogp",sep = ""),header = TRUE)
Pdat
```
In the first column the age group is listed and in the following columns a birth ogive curve is listed for a given period. Every time a new birth ogive estimated is available, a new column is added. The content of the *wgharp.ogp* looks like 
```{r echo = FALSE}
Pper
```
The first column denotes the start of the time period a given birth ogive curve applies for, and the second column denotes the end of the time period the birth ogive curve is valid. The reason for this is that usually data for several years are pooled together when estimating the birth ogive curve in order to ensure enough data to obtain a reasonable estimated of the birth ogive. Note that the number of rows in the *wgharp.ogp* file corresponds to the number of columns in the *wgharp.ogi* file (minus 1 since one column represents the age group).

## Priors used
Priors used for the various parameters are specified in the *priors.dat* file. The content of the file looks like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
priors <- read.table(paste("Data/harpeast/priors.dat",sep = ""),header = FALSE)
priors
```
Each row specify mean and the standard deviation of a Gaussian prior used for a given parameter. In the first colum the mean value is found and in the second column the standard deviation is found. In the first row the prior distribution of the initial population size $K$ is specified, in the seccond row the prior distribution of the 1+ mortality $M$ is specified, and in the third row the prior distribution of the pup mortality $M_0$ is specified.



## Loading the data
In order to load the data you have to specify which population you want to load the data for. The various alternatives are *harpeast*, *harpwest*, and *hooded* (which is the hooded seal population in the West Ice - the ice along the east coast of Greenland). In the examples that follows we will use the *harpeast* population. To load the data used you run the following command:
```{r eval = FALSE}
data <- load.data(population = "harpeast")
```
To explore the data object you can
```{r eval = TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(rSPAMM)

#Set population
population = 'harpeast'
#Load the data
data <- load.data(population = population)
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
names(data)
```
The data object is a list and you can further explore the actual values used by e.g.,
```{r}
data$Amax

data$pupProductionData

```


# Parameters to be estimed and how to load them
As briefly mentioned earlier the population dynamics model is described by three parameters. The initial population size $K$, the mortality of the 1+ population $M$, and the pup mortality $M_0$. The initial population size is the population size for the year the model is fit from, and this is determined by the availability of the catch data. The earliest catch data is from 1946, so the model is fit from 1946 and up to present. It also predicts the population dynamics into the future, and this is default set to 15 years. 

To load the initial values of the parameters to be estimated run:
```{r eval = TRUE}
parameters <- load.initial.values(population = population)
```
The parameters object is also a list and the content looks like this for the *harpeast* population
```{r eval = TRUE}
parameters
```
Here *logK* is the log transformed initial population size, *M0tilde* is the logit transformed pup mortality, and *Mtilde* is the logit transformed 1+ mortality (seals of age 1 and greater). The reason that transformed parameters are estimated instead of the non transformed parameters is that the log transformation of the initial population ensures that the model provides a stricktly positive estimate of the initial population. The logit tranformation of the mortalities ensures that the estimates are bounded between 0 and 1. 

# Model fitting and obtaining estimates
The model is implemented in the Template Model Builder framework and makes use of the *TMB* R package. This means that the code for model is written in C++ and will thus have to be compiled first time you try to fit a model. It will also have to be recompiled if the model is updated. This is not something the user need to worry about. When installing the *rSPAMM* package the *TMB* package and all dependencies should also be installed automatically, and when loading the model it automatically checks wether the C++ code needs to be compiled or not. If it needs to be compiled it is done automatically.

## Loading the model object and fitting the model
When compiling the model a model object, a *.dll* file is created and this has to be loaded first. This is done by running:

```{r eval = FALSE}
obj = load.model.object(dat = data,par = parameters)
```
```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
obj = load.model.object(dat = data,par = parameters)
#load(file = "obj_object")
```
The *obj* object is an object containing the log-likelihood value and the gradient for the initial parameters. This is used by fitting the model using an ordinary built in optimization routine in R. The default optimization routine used is *nlminb*, but this can be changed. (MARTIN: bør vi legge inn en mulighet til å endre optimiseringsrutiner). The content of the *obj* object looks like this:
```{r}
names(obj)
```
The value of the log likelihood and the gradient of the log likelihood for a given set of parameters can be explored by
```{r eval = FALSE}
obj$fn()

obj$gr()
```
```{r}
obj$fn()

obj$gr()
```

To fit the model run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
opt <- run.model(object = obj)
```

When the model is fitted some key information will be written to screen. This key information show whether the model converged, what type of convergence and estimates of the parameters that describes the modelled population dynamics. It might look like this:
```{r echo = FALSE}
opt = nlminb(obj$par,obj$fn,obj$gr)
```



## Obtaining the estimated quantities
In addition to the estimated parameters needed to describe the modelled population dynamics of a population the model fit also provides the user with other relevant quantities. The Table below lists the various quantities obtained.

The model results can be obtained by running:
```{r eval = FALSE}
res <- model.results(dat = data,object = obj,optimized = opt)
```
```{r echo = FALSE,include = FALSE}
res <- model.results(dat = data,object = obj,optimized = opt)
```
The *res* object is a list containing all the estimates of the quantities listed in the Table above.

```{r}
names(res)
```

A table for the most interesting quantities needed can be made by running:
```{r eval = FALSE}
partab <- par.table(results=res, dat=data) 
```
```{r include = FALSE}
partab <- par.table(results=res, dat=data, tab2flex=FALSE) 
```
```{r}
partab 
```

# Visualize the modelled population dynamics
In this section we will show how to create graphics to present the various output of the modelling results. To display the modelled pup abundance and the 1+ abundance you run the following command:
```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.N(res,data)
```
![Modelled pup abundance and 1+ abundance.](figures/fitted_N0_N1_with_projections.png){ width=98%}


You can also plot the fit to the pup abundance and the 1+ abundance separately by specifying that in the *component* variable:
```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.N(res,data,component = c("N0"))
```
![Modelled pup abundance.](figures/fitted_pup_abundance.png){ width=98%}

```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.N(res,data,component = c("N1"))
```
![Modelled abundance.](figures/fitted_adult_abun.png){ width=98%}

You can also choose to not plot the future projections by setting *projections = FALSE* . 
```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.N(res,data,projections = FALSE)
```
![Modelled pup and 1+ abundance  withouth projections.](figures/fitted_abun_no_proj.png){ width=98%}

The confidence intervals can be turned off by setting *conf.int = FALSE* and the horizontal lines for $N_{lim}$, $N_{50}$ and $N_{70}$ can be turned off by setting *plot.Nlims = FALSE*. For other options you can run *?plot.N*.

If you want to visualize certain types of data you can plot the historical catch level used, the fecundity vector and the birth ogive curves for each time period. To plot the catch data run the *plot.catch()* function:
```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.catch(catch = data$Cdata)
```
![Reported catch levels of pups and 1+ animals with bars next to each other.](figures/catch_data_dodge.png){ width=98%}


Default the bars are next to each other, but the bars can be plotted on top of each other by setting *position = "stack"*:
```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.catch(catch = data$Cdata,position = "stack")
```
![Reported catch levels of pups and 1+ animals with bars on top of each other.](figures/catch_data_stack.png){ width=98%}

If you want to explore the birth ogive data used for various periods you can run the *plot.ogive()* function:
```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.ogive(dat = data)
```
![Birth ogive for different periods.](figures/birth_ogive.png){ width=98%}

Since fecundity rates is not available for all years they are interpolated between missing years. You can plot the fecundity rates used in the modelling by running *plot.fecundity()*. Default it plots both the linear interpolated fecundity rates and the observed fecundity ratesfor a given population.
```{r eval = FALSE}
plot.fecundity(dat = data)
```
![Fecundity rates used in the modelling.](figures/fecundity.png){ width=98%}


# Exploring various catch options
In this section we will describe how to explore various catch options such as finding the equilibrium catch level, i.e., the fixed annual catch level that keeps the future projected population abundance constant, finding the catch level that would reduce the population to $N_{70}$ (70% of the current population size) with probability 0.8 over a 15-years period, and Potential Biological Removals (PBR) catch level.

## Equilibrium catch level
To find the equilibrium catch level we run the function *find.eq.quota*:
```{r eval = FALSE}
EquilibriumCatch <- find.eq.quota(population='harpeast')
```
```{r include = FALSE}
EquilibriumCatch <- find.eq.quota(population='harpeast')

```
```{r}
EquilibriumCatch
```

Default is that the function assumes that zero pups are in the catch and that all catch are 1 year old animals or more. To change he proportion of pups and 1+ animals in the catch you use the *quota* variable, i.e., the following finds the equilibrium catch level assuming 15% pups and 85% 1+ animals in the catch:
```{r eval = FALSE}
EquilibriumCatch <- find.eq.quota(population='harpeast', quota = c(0.15,0.85))
```

You have now found the fixed annual catch level that stabilizes the future 1+ population under the estimated model for the *harpeast* population and can re-run the model using this equilibrium catch level for the future projection. Default in the when running the model fit assumes zero catch for the future predictions. To re-run the model you run the following code:
```{r eval = FALSE}
datEq <- load.data('harpeast', catch_quota=EquilibriumCatch)
objEq <- load.model.object(dat=datEq)
optEq <- run.model(objEq)
resEq <- model.results(datEq, objEq, optEq)
```
```{r include = FALSE}
datEq <- load.data('harpeast', catch_quota=EquilibriumCatch)
objEq <- load.model.object(dat=datEq)
optEq <- run.model(objEq)
resEq <- model.results(datEq, objEq, optEq)
```
The modelled population trajectory with the equilibrium catch level looks like this: (Create figure below)

## $N_{70}$ catch level
To find the the catch level that would reduce the population to 70% with probability 0.8 over a 15-year period you run the command *find.N70.quota*:
```{r eval = FALSE}
catchN70 <- find.N70.quota(population='harpeast')
```
```{r include = FALSE}
catchN70 <- find.N70.quota(population='harpeast')
```
```{r}
catchN70
```
Default is that the function assumes that zero pups are in the catch and that all catch are 1 year old animals or more. To change he proportion of pups and 1+ animals in the catch you use the *quota* variable, i.e., the following finds the $N{7+}$ catch level assuming 15% pups and 85% 1+ animals in the catch:
```{r eval = FALSE}
catchN70 <- find.N70.quota(population='harpeast',quota = c(0.15,0.85))
```
To re-run the model using this catch level you repeat as for the equilibrium catch level
```{r eval = FALSE}
dat70 <- load.data('harpeast', catch_quota=catchN70)
obj70 <- load.model.object(dat=dat70, template='harps_and_hoods_population_model2')
opt70 <- run.model(obj70)
res70 <- model.results(dat70, obj70, opt70)

```
```{r include = FALSE}
dat70 <- load.data('harpeast', catch_quota=catchN70)
obj70 <- load.model.object(dat=dat70, template='harps_and_hoods_population_model2')
opt70 <- run.model(obj70)
res70 <- model.results(dat70, obj70, opt70)

```
the modelled population trajectory with this catch level looks like this: (Instead of making a seperate figure for each catch level, maybe a figure showing all three catch levels could be made...)

## The Potential Biological Removals (PBR) catch level
Potential Biological Removals has been defined as:
$$PBR=\frac{1}{2}R_{max}F_rN_{min},$$
where $R_{max}$ is the maximum rate of increase for the population (default to 0.12 for pinnipeds), $F_r$ is the recovery factor with values between 0.1 and 1 (default to 0.5), and $N_{min}$ is the estimated population size using 20% percentile of the log-normal distribution. The PBR catch level assumes that the age structure of the removals is proportional to the age composition of the population (i.e. 15% based on the current population estimates). To find the PBR catch level using the default parameters you run:
```{r eval = FALSE}
pbrCatch <- PBR(n0=n0, n1=n1, se0=se0, se1=se1)
```
```{r include = FALSE}
pbrCatch <- PBR(n0=partab[4,3], n1=partab[5,3], se0=partab[4,4], se1=partab[5,4],
              rMax=0.12, Fr=0.5,quota=partab[c(4,5),3]/partab[6,3])
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
pbrCatch
```



where n0 is the current population size, n1 is the current 1+ population size, se0 is the standard deviation of the estimated current pup abundance, and se1 is the standard deviation of the estimated current 1+ abundance. Recall from the Table above that these quantities could be found using the *par.tab* command.

Re-run the model using this catch level
```{r eval = FALSE}
datPBR <- load.data(population, pbrCatch)
objPBR <- load.model.object(dat=datPBR)
optPBR <- run.model(objPBR)
resPBR <- model.results(datPBR, objPBR, optPBR)
partPBR <- par.table(resPBR, datPBR) 
```

# Appendix

## The population dynamics model
The population model is an age-structured population dynamics model. For initiation of the model it is assumed that the population had a stable age structure in year $y_0 = 1945$, i.e.,
$$
N_{i,y_0} = N_{y_0}s_{1+}^{i-1}(1-s_{1+}), \quad i = 1,\ldots,A-1,
$$
$$
N_{A,y_0}=N_{y_0}s_{1+}^{A-1}.
$$
Here $A$ is the maximum age group containing seals aged $A$ and higher, and set to 20 years, and $N_{y_0}$ is the estimated initial population size in year $y_0$. The model is parameterized by the natural mortalities $M_0$ and $M_{1+}$ for the pups and seals of 1 year and older, respectively. These mortalities determine the survival probabilities $s_0 = \exp(-M_0)$ and $s_{1+} = \exp(-M_{1+})$.

The model has the following set of recursion equations:
$$
N_{a,y}=\left(N_{0,y-1}-C_{0,y-1}\right)s_0,
$$
$$
N_{a,y}=\left(N_{a-1,y-1}-C_{a-1,y-1}\right)s_{1+},\quad a=2,\ldots,A-1,
$$
$$
N_{A,y}=\left[\left(N_{A-1,y-1}-C_{a-1,y-1}\right)+\left(N_{A,y-1}-C_{A,y-1}\right)\right]s_{1+}.
$$
Since available data do not allow for more detailed age-dependence in survival to be estimated it is assumed that the mortality rates are age-independent within the 1+ group. The $C_{a,y}$ are the age-specific catch numbers. Catch records are aggregated over age, and only provide information about the annual number of pups and number of 1+ seals caught. To obtain $C_{a,y}$ we assume that the age-distribution in the catch follows the modelled age distribution and employ *pro rata* rules in the model:
$$
C_{a,y} = C_{1+,y}\frac{N_{a,y}}{N_{1+,y}},\quad a = 1,\ldots,A.
$$

where $N_{1+,y} = \sum_{y=1}^A N_{a,y}$, with $N_{a,y}$ being the number of individuals ate age $a$ in year $y$.


The modelled pup abundance is given by
$$
N_{0,y}=\frac{F_y}{2}\sum_{a=1}^Ap_{a,y}N_{a.y},
$$

where $N_{a,y}/2$ is the number of females ate age $a$ in year $y$, $F_y$ is the time-varying fecundity rates and $p_{a,y}$ are the time-varying age specific proportions of mature females.

The model is fitted to the survey pup production estimates and the fecundity rates by maximum likelihood. Assuming normality for the pup production estimates, their contribution to the log-likelihood function is
$$
\sum_y-\log(\sigma_{0,y})-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(N_{0,y}-n_{0,y}\right)^2}{\left(\sigma_{0,y}\right)^2},
$$
where $n_{0,y}$ and $\sigma_{0,y}$ denote the survey pup production count and corresponding standard error for year $y$. 

The model has a Bayesian flavour as priors are imposed on some of the parameters. A vague normal prior is assumed for the initial population size $N_{y_0}$. A truncated normal prior was used for both the pup mortalities $M_0$ and $M_{1+}$.

All parameter estimates are found by maximizing the likelihood function using the R package *TMB*.


## Complete code for assessment
